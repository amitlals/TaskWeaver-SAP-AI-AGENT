    <img src="./.asset/logo.color.svg" width="45" /> TaskWeaver - AI Agent with SAP HANA DB Plugin
</h1>

A **code-first** agent framework for seamlessly planning and executing data analytics tasks. 
This innovative framework interprets user requests through coded snippets and efficiently 
coordinates a variety of plugins in the form of functions to execute 
data analytics tasks. 


**Rationale and Prerequisites for TaskWeaver, SAP S/4HANA and HANA DB custom Plugin:**
- [x] Using Custom **SAP HANA Plugins**: TaskWeaver should support custom plugins for doing things like getting data from SAP S/4HANA product and sales or custom tables, using specific SAP data extraction algorithms, and making the connection plugin with the â€˜hdbcliâ€™ python package deployment.
- [x] Handling Complex Data Structures: It must handle complex data formats, like pandas DataFrame, for advanced data processing and facilitate easy data transfer between plugins.
- [x] Stateful Execution: TaskWeaver should maintain state across conversations, processing user inputs and executing tasks in an iterative manner throughout the session.
- [x] Data Schema Inspection and Action: Prior to executing tasks, TaskWeaver needs to inspect the data schema in the database and use this information for actions before analyzing the SAP product and sales data.
- [x] Natural Language Responses: The system should provide user-friendly responses in natural language, summarizing execution results, such as the amount of sales order per product details.
- [x] Dynamic Code Generation: TaskWeaver must generate code on-the-fly to meet ad-hoc user requests, including tasks not covered by existing plugins, like visualizing SAP data related to Sales and product tables.
- [x] Incorporating Domain Knowledge: The framework should integrate domain-specific knowledge to enhance LLM's planning and tool usage, ensuring accurate and reliable results in complex domains.
- [x] Persisting Results: It should offer a mechanism to save outcomes, such as DataFrames or images, to persistent storage, with options for business users to download these artifacts.

## Highlights

- [x] **Rich data structure** - TaskWeaver allows you to work with rich data structures in Python, such as DataFrames, instead of dealing with strings.
- [x] **Customized algorithms** - TaskWeaver allows you to encapsulate your own algorithms into plugins and orchestrate them.
- [x] **Incorporating domain-specific knowledge** - TaskWeaver is designed to incorporat domain-specific knowledge easily to improve the reliability.
- [x] **Stateful execution** - TaskWeaver is designed to support stateful execution of the generated code to ensure consistent and smooth user experience.
- [x] **Code verification** - TaskWeaver is designed to verify the generated code before execution. It can detect potential issues in the generated code and provide suggestions to fix them.
- [x] **Easy to use** - TaskWeaver is easy to use with sample plugins, examples and tutorials to help you get started. TaskWeaver offers an open-box experience, allowing users to run it immediately after installation.
- [x] **Easy to debug** - TaskWeaver is easy to debug with detailed and transparent logs to help you understand the entire process, including LLM prompts, the code generation, and execution process.
- [x] **Security consideration** - TaskWeaver supports a basic session management to keep different users' data separate. The code execution is separated into different processes to avoid mutal interference.
- [x] **Easy extension** - TaskWeaver is easy to extend to accomplish more complex tasks with multiple agents as the plugins.

## Quick Start


### 1. Installation & Setup SAP S/4HA for TaskWeaver and Plugin Deployment
TaskWeaver requires **Python >= 3.10**. It can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
# [optional to create conda environment]
# conda create -n taskweaver python=3.10
# conda activate taskweaver

# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver.git
cd TaskWeaver
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2. Configure the LLMs
Before running TaskWeaver, you need to provide your LLM configurations. Taking OpenAI as an example, you can configure `taskweaver_config.json` file as follows. 

#### OpenAI
```json
{
"llm.api_key": "the api key",
"llm.model": "the model name, e.g., gpt-4"
}
```

ðŸ’¡ TaskWeaver also supports other LLMs and advanced configurations, please check the [documents](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/docs/overview) for more details. 


#### 3. To establish a connection with TaskWeaver, input your SAP HANA Database connection details into the hana-connect.ymal and validate hana-connect.py plugin details.
#configurations: # fill below details, please ensure SAP system and HANA DB are fully operational and connected. 
 ```
hana_host: "xx.xx.xx.xx"
hana_port: "30xx"
hana_user: "xxx"
hana_password: "xxx"
api_type: openai
api_base: https://api.openai.com
api_key: ""
Deployment_name: "gpt-4*"
```

#### 4. Install chainlit package prior to triggering TaskWeaver Web UI, please refers to [web UI docs](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/docs/usage/webui) for more details.
Install the chainlit package by **pip install chainlit** if you don't have it in your env.

#### 5. Start the service by running the following command.
```
cd playground/UI/
chainlit run app.py
```
Open the browser with http://localhost:8000 and you can start the TaskWeaver App connected with SAP

## Other Demo Examples

The demos were made based on the [web UI](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/docs/usage/webui), which is better for displaying the generated artifacts such as images. 
The demos could also be conducted in the command line interface. 

#### Example 1: Pull data from a database and apply an anomaly detection algorithm
In this example, we will show you how to use TaskWeaver to pull data from a database and apply an anomaly detection algorithm.

[Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver/assets/7489260/248b9a0c-d504-4708-8c2e-e004689ee8c6)

If you want to follow this example, you need to configure the `sql_pull_data` plugin in the `project/plugins/sql_pull_data.yaml` file.
You need to provide the following information:
```yaml
api_type: azure or openai
api_base: ...
api_key: ...
api_version: ...
deployment_name: ...
sqlite_db_path: sqlite:///../../../sample_data/anomaly_detection.db
```
The `sql_pull_data` plugin is a plugin that pulls data from a database. It takes a natural language request as input and returns a DataFrame as output.

This plugin is implemented based on [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/).
If you want to follow this example, you need to install the Langchain package:
```bash
pip install langchain
pip install tabulate
```



For more examples, please refer to our [paper](http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2311.17541). 

> ðŸ’¡ The planning of TaskWeaver are based on the LLM model. Therefore, if you want to repeat the examples, the execution process may be different
> from what you see in the videos. For example, in the second demo, the assistant may ask the user which prediction algorithm should be used.
> Typically, more concrete prompts will help the model to generate better plans and code.
